# Graduation-Project
My graduation project for getting a bachelor's degree in IT
This a java 1.6 program that have been developed with the help of Eclipse IDE.
At the moment it's not well commented and if it's sometimes in some block of codes it's french commented because we study IT in French and didn't have the time to translate :P
all I wanted to say is that don't blame me for the code quality and readability.
Please use this source code only for educational pupose , try not to rip it and sell it, in case if you did for some reason or another, try to shoot some credits at least. 
I'd like to thank the stackoverflow community for the efforts and the help they contributed on our developing of this application.
Feel free to contact me for any questions , I'd be happy to help.
Enjoy!
